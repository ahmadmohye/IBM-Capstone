## Analyzing San-Francisco’s 2016 Crime Data

### 1-Introduction: -
“Safety and security don't just happen; they are the result of collective consensus and public
investment. We owe our children, the most vulnerable citizens in our society, a life free of violence and
fear.” - Nelson Mandela
Safety is one of the most important aspects of life each person should have, and we will do our best today to assure
and enhance the Police system in San-Francisco , California , USA by analyzing the Crime Data in 2016 looking for
any patterns that could help us to be more safe.

### 2-Business Problem: -
Government of San-Francisco are doing their best to make the city safer, so we will help them understand the
patterns of what’s actually happening and what are the most places that has crime and at exactly what time, and
maybe the reason for those crimes.
According to Edwin M., SF Mayor, the budget for the City for FY 2016-17 is $9.6 billion dollars, half of them is for
the Public Health, Police, Fire, and Recreation and Parks.
So, the police department budget may be around $2 billion dollar in 2016. Can we make a better use of this budget
to attain more safety? This our problem that we will try to solve talking about an example only.
